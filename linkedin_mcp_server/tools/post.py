"""
LinkedIn post search and post engagement tools.

``search_posts`` performs LinkedIn's global content search (the "Posts" results
tab) using innerText extraction, so informal "we're hiring" / "Buscamos ..."
posts can be found before a formal job listing is published. It mirrors
search_people: build a /search/results/content/ URL, scroll to load results,
and return the raw innerText for the LLM to parse, plus post-permalink
references.

The other three tools write. ``react_to_post`` adds a reaction,
``comment_on_post`` publishes a comment and ``repost_post`` reshares, all
against one post permalink of the kind ``search_posts`` and ``get_feed`` return
as ``references[...]`` entries of kind ``feed_post``. They return an action
status rather than ``{url, sections}``; see ``post_action_result``.

Only the reaction fires without a confirmation flag, and that asymmetry is
deliberate rather than an oversight. A reaction is one control the owner can
un-click, while a comment and a repost are content published under their name
that a retry duplicates. ``react_to_post`` also refuses to click a control that
is already pressed, because on LinkedIn that click *removes* a reaction.

        a formal job listing exists. This is global content search, distinct
